# UI/UX

## Strategy
### Owner Stories

- As the owner of the website, I want to create a user-friendly and attractive website so that my visitors will enjoy their time on the site, as well as easily obtain the game on different platforms.

- As the game developer, I want a Support page so that our players can provide feedback to us regarding game issues or improvements.

- As the game developer, I want the existing and potential players to visit the website so that we can update our players with content update news and host special events on the site.

- As the owner of the Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) series, I want the fans of the series to visit the website so that I can let them experience Demon Slayer in other forms other than the anime, such as the game.
