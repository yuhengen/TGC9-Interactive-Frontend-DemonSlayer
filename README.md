# Demon Slayer - Dark War

Welcome to Demon Slayer - Dark War, a game where you will play as Tanjiro to gather and form your team of Demon Slayers! This website will be used to promote the game and give our potential players a glimpse of how the game looks like.

Demo of the site can be found [here](https://yuhengen.github.io/TGC9-Interactive-Frontend-DemonSlayer/).

# UI/UX
# Identifying the Users (Strategy)
The primary purpose of this website is to let players download the game, as well as to give the game and the Demon Slayer series more exposure. The contents of the website will therefore contain the download links and more information about the Demon Slayer - Dark War game, targeted at potential players.

## Owner Stories

- As the owner of the website, I want to create a user-friendly and attractive website so that my visitors can easily download the game on different platforms, as well as enjoy their time on the site.

- As the game developer, I want a Support page so that our players can provide feedback to us regarding game issues or improvements.

- As the game developer and publisher, I want to keep the players updated on the newest developments of the game.

- As the game developer, I want the existing and potential players to visit the website so that we can showcase to them the gameplay videos and its contents, as well as engaging in special events and contests.

- As the owner of the Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) series, I want the fans of the series to visit the website so that I can let them experience Demon Slayer in other forms other than the anime, such as the game.

## User Stories (Players and Potential players)

# Developing the Site Structure (Structure)

# Developing Page Structure and Organize Interactions (Skeleton)
Most important features and information are displayed first. Our priority is to have players DOWNLOAD the game, so it is the first thing we see upon entering the website. The font size is also generally the largest so as to catch attention.

The Demon Slayer - Dark War wireframes will be added soon.

# Designing the Graphics User Interface (Surface) 
## Colors
After some research and considerations, the main colors I decided to use are those closely related to the Demon Slayer logo and theme.
- Black/Grey to symbolize darkness and calamity.
- White to contrast the Black, the light in the darkness, as well as a symbol of faith.
- Red to symbolize chaos and blood.

## Fonts
The fonts which are mainly used on the website is Sans Serif, the default font family. I also used the Demon Slayer title font [Blood Crow](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/blood-crow-font/) for decorative purposes.

# Technologies
I used HTML5 to structure the webpages and CSS3 to style the them, and also utilized Bootstrap 4 for layout, such as the NavBar and Accordion for the display of the Anime episodes' title and description.
