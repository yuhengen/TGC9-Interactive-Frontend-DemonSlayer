# UI/UX

## Strategy
### Owner Stories

- As the owner of the website, I want to create a user-friendly and attractive website so that my visitors will enjoy their time on the site, as well as easily obtain the game on different platforms.

- As the game developer, I want a Support page so that our players can provide feedback to us regarding game issues or improvements.

- As the game developer, I want the existing and potential players to visit the website so that we can showcase to them the gameplay videos and its contents, as well as engaging in special events and contests.

- As the owner of the Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) series, I want the fans of the series to visit the website so that I can let them experience Demon Slayer in other forms other than the anime, such as the game.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find a website to download the game so that I can play it on different platforms.

- As a player, I want a platform where I can reach the support team so that I can provide valuable feedback and improvements to the development team of the game.

- As a user, I want a website where I can preview the game and its contents so that I will know whether I want to try the game out.
